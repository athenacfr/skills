# Open Pull Request

Create a well-structured GitHub PR from the current branch using `gh` CLI.

## Prerequisites

Ensure `gh` is authenticated: `gh auth status` (repo scope required).
If not authenticated, instruct the user to run `gh auth login`.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Gather Context

Run the bundled script to collect all context in one call:

```
python "<path-to-skill>/scripts/gather_pr_context.py"
```

Returns JSON with: `branch`, `upstream`, `base_branch`, `commit_log`, `diff_stat`, `uncommitted_changes`, and `pr_template` (if found).

### Phase 2: Prepare

1. If there are uncommitted changes, ask the user if they want to commit first
2. If the branch has no upstream, note that `gh pr create` will push automatically
3. Analyze the commit history and diff to draft:
   - **Title**: conventional commit style `<type>(<scope>): <description>` (under 70 chars)
   - **Body**: **ALWAYS** follow the repo's `.github/pull_request_template.md` if it exists. Read the template, fill in every section with relevant content from the commits and diff. Do NOT skip sections — if a section is not applicable, explicitly mark it as N/A. Only use the fallback format below if no PR template exists in the repo.

Fallback body format (only when no PR template exists):

```
## Context
[Why this change exists — explain the motivation/problem BEFORE describing the solution]

## Changes
[Grouped by purpose/area, NOT by file. Bullet points.]

## Feature Flags
[Only include this section if feature flags were actually added. Otherwise omit entirely.]

## Breaking Changes
[Only include if there are breaking changes. Highlight prominently.]
```

### Phase 3: Confirm & Create

1. Present the draft title and body to the user
2. Ask for approval or edits
3. Once confirmed, create the PR:

   ```
   gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   <body>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

   - Add `--base <branch>` if targeting a non-default branch
   - Add `--draft` if the user requests a draft PR
   - Add `--label`, `--reviewer`, `--assignee` flags if the user specifies them

4. Output the PR URL

## Anti-Patterns (DO NOT)

- **DO NOT** create the PR without showing the draft to the user first
- **DO NOT** add AI attribution or "Co-Authored-By" lines
- **DO NOT** push force or rebase without explicit user request
- **DO NOT** list files individually in the PR body — group changes by purpose
- **DO NOT** include changes from the base branch in the description — only describe what this branch adds
